@version 1.1.0

Implements some basic native controls for iOS. This library should be
considered "alpha" release, since it's very new. It supports iOS 7 with partial support
for iOS 6. Keep in mind that iOS 6 often renders with very different intents than iOS 7,
and the plugin makes no effort to ensure the same visual semantics. That is to say that
a `tintColor` on a navigation bar in iOS 6 affects the *background color* while on iOS 7
it affects the *foreground color*. Or, on iOS 6, the navigation bar needs to start at y-
offset zero, while on iOS 7, it needs to start at y-offset 20.

The library has been designed so as to be simple to code against: generally you don't
need to worry about a lot of asynchronous code except for event-handling. It's also
somewhat iOS-centric, so although the protocol could easily be implemented for another
platform, the lingo is iOS-inspired.

The license is MIT, so feel free to use, enhance, etc. If you do make changes that would
benefit the community, it would be great if you would contribute them back to the original
plugin, but that is not required.

## Repository

Available on [Github](https://github.com/photokandyStudios/PKNativeControls). Contributions welcome!

## Minimum Requirements

* Cordova 2.9 or higher (tested 3.3, 3.4)
* iOS 6 (partial; no attempt is made to reconcile visual semantics)
* iOS 7

## Installation

Add the plugin using Cordova's CLI:

```
cordova plugin add com.photokandy.nativecontrols
```

## Use

All interaction with the library is through `window.nativeControls`. 

### `Rect`s

`Rect`s are used when you need to specify the frame for a native control. A frame is simply the position and size of a native control on the screen.

The `Rect` method takes four parameters: `x` and `y` coordinates for the top-left corner of the frame and `w` and `h` values indicating the size of the frame. An object of the form `{origin: {x: #, y: #}, size: {w: #, h: #}}` is returned.

```
var aRect = window.nativeControls.Rect (10, 50, 100, 200);
```
The above rectangle indicates a rectangle with the top left corner at (10, 50) and a bottom right corner at (110, 250).

If you want to copy a value of type `Rect`, you can do so as follows:

```
var aCopy = window.nativeControls.Rect (aRect);
```

**Note:** You aren't required to use window.nativeControls.Rect as long as you pass in an object of the above form.


### `Color`s

`Color`s are used when you need to specify the color of an item. Instead of passing hex colors (like `#204080`), the red, green, blue, and alpha components are passed. Alternatively, a few predefined colors can be passed as a string (like `BLUE`).

Four parameters are required unless a predefined color is used -- the first three specify the red, green, and blue values, and range from 0 to 255. The last value specifies the alpha value, and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. 

The returned object is of the form `{r: #, g: #, b: #, a: #}`.

```
var aBlueColor = window.nativeControls.Color ( 0, 0, 128, 1.0 );
var aRedColor = window.nativeControls.Color ( 'RED' );
```

If you want to copy a `Color` value in order to modify it, you can use this:

```
var aColorCopy = window.nativeControls.Color ( aBlueColor );
```

**Note:** You aren't required to use window.nativeControls.Color as long as you pass in an object of the above form.

#### Predefined colors
* `Clear`
* `Black`
* `Blue`
* `Green`
* `Red`
* `DarkGray`
* `Gray`
* `LightGray`
* `White`
* `Cyan`
* `Yellow`
* `Magenta`
* `Orange`
* `Purple`
* `Brown`

If you want to define other colors, you can use the following:

```
window.nativeControls.colors.darkred = window.nativeControls.Color(127, 0, 0, 1.0);
var aDarKRedColor = window.nativeControls.Color ("darkred");
```

*Note:* the property on `colors` must be lowercase. When calling `Color`, the case does not matter.

### Native Controls

All native controls are based on a `NativeControl` class that is initialized with the type of control you wish to create. This can be done by calling any of the native control creation methods:

* `NavigationBar`
* `NavigationItem`
* `BarButton` (**deprecated**; do not use)
* `BarTextButton`
* `BarImageButton`
* `ToolBar`
* `MessageBox`
* `ActionSheet`
* `Button`

For example, you can create a `BarTextButton` using

```
var aButton = window.nativeControls.BarTextButton();
```

When you are done with a native control, you should always destroy it, otherwise your app will leak resources. Destroy it as follows:

```
aButton.destroy();
```

#### Buttons

Regular buttons can be positioned anywhere on the screen, and can display text, images, or both. Bear in mind that they will not track with the scroll of the underlying webview. On iOS 7 there is no border or background while on iOS 6, the button has a white background with a rounded border.

```
var aButton = window.nativeControls.Button();
```

In order to display, a button must have at least a title or an image in addition to a frame:

```
aButton.title = "Button";
aButton.image = "path/to/image"; // no .png or @2x
aButton.frame = window.nativeControls.Rect(100,100,144,44);
```

Images will use "@2x" retina assets automatically if provided, and will scale them appropriately if @1x retina assets are not provided. If the image is in the `www/img` directory, or a subdirectory, refer to it like so:

```
aButton.image = "/www/img/book";
```


To show a button, add it to the view:

```
aButton.addToView();
```

To respond to a tap, listen for the `tap` event:

```
aButton.addEventListener ( "tap", function () { /* button tapped */ } );
```

##### Properties

* `frame <Rect>` - the location and size of the `Button`
* `image <String>` - the path to the image. On iOS 7, will be colored with the `tintColor`; on iOS 6, the image is rendered as-is.
* `title <String>` - the name of the `Button`
* `tintColor <Color>` - `Color` for the `Button` text/icon **Not Supported on iOS 6**

##### Methods

* `destroy` - destroys the control
* `addToView` - adds the button to the web view
* `removeFromView` - removes the button from the web view
* `addEventListener (event, handler)` - adds an event listener to the button
* `removeEventListener (event, handler)` - removes an event listener from the button


##### Events

Buttons support quite a few events. You can attach a listener using `addToEventListener`. 

```
Events supported:
editingChanged
editingDidBegin
editingDidEnd
editingDidEndOnExit
touchCancel
touchDown
touchDownRepeat
touchDragEnter
touchDragExit
touchDragInside
touchDragOutside
touchUpInside
tap
touchUpOutside
valueChanged
```

#### Bar buttons

Bar buttons can be added to `NavigationItem`s and `ToolBar`s. They can be a text label or an icon. They will be tinted with their parent container's tint color (unless overridden).

In the example below we create a text and image bar button. Notice that we specify the type of content (text or image). Once done, you must not assign an image to a text bar button or the reverse. If you do, you may encounter strange layout issues.

```
var button1 = window.nativeControls.BarTextButton();
button1.title = "Add"
var button2 = window.nativeControls.BarImageButton();
button2.image = "/path/to/image" // no .png or @2x
```

In order to respond to a button tap, you can attach an event handler:

```
button1.addEventListener ( "tap", function (evt) { ... } );
```

You can also remove event listeners when you no longer need to respond to the event.

Images will use "@2x" retina assets automatically if provided, and will scale them appropriately if @1x retina assets are not provided. If the image is in the `www/img` directory, or a subdirectory, refer to it like so:

```
button3.image = "/www/img/book";
```

##### Properties

* `title <string>` - the title of the button (only on `BarTextButton`s)
* `image <string>` - the image for the button (only on `BarImageButton`s). On iOS 7 colored by `tintColor`; on iOS 6, the image is used as-is.
* `tintColor <Color>` - the tint color of the button **not supported on iOS 6**

##### Methods

* `addEventListener (event, handler)` - adds an event listener to the button
* `removeEventListener (event, handler)` - removes an event listener from the button
* `destroy` - destroys the control

##### Events

* `tap` - fired when the button is tapped.

#### `NavigationBar`s

This will create a navigation bar at the top of the window with a white background and a
red tint color (for any buttons) on iOS 7:

```
var navigationBar = window.nativeControls.NavigationBar();
navigationBar.tintColor = window.nativeControls.Color ( "red" );
navigationBar.barTintColor = window.nativeControls.Color ( "white" );
navigationBar.addToView();
```

Navigation bars can be re-oriented on the screen:

```
navigationBar.frame = window.nativeControls.Rect ( 320, 20, 768-320, 44 );
```

Navigation bars in iOS 7 usually carry translucency (blurring of the background); this can be turned off if desired:

```
navigationBar.translucent = false;
```

Note: your content is not moved out of the way of the navigation bar. You need to apply the appropriate padding, margins, or positioning in order to keep your content out of the way. The benefit here is if you allow the content to scroll under the navigation bar, you can inherit the translucent effect present in iOS 7.

Second note: For iOS 7, your navigation bar must be at the `y` position of `20`. The plugin properly extens the navigation bar beyond the scroll bar for you. This means the height should be `44` pixels. On iOS 6, the `y` position should be `0`.

##### Properties

* `barTintColor <Color>` - the background color of the navigation bar; **not supported on iOS 6**
* `tintColor <Color>` - the tint color of the buttons on the bar for iOS 7; background color on iOS 6.
* `textColor <Color>` - the text color; **not supported on iOS 6**
* `frame <Rect>` - the location of the navigation bar on screen
* `translucent <boolean>` - indicates if the navigation bar is translucent or opaque; **not supported on iOS 6**

##### Methods

* `addToView` - adds the navigation bar to the web view
* `removeFromView` - removes the navigation bar from the web view
* `push ( NavigationItem )` - pushes a `NavigationItem` onto the bar
* `pop` - pops the currently visible `NavigationItem` off the bar
* `destroy` - destroys the control

##### Events

* None


#### `NavigationItem`s

`NavigationBar`s by themselves aren't terribly interesting. In order to display text or controls, you need to create a `NavigationItem`:

```
var navigationItem = window.nativeControls.NavigationItem();
navigationItem.title = "View Title";
```

At this point, one can add `BarButton`s to the left or right side:

```
navigationItem.leftButtons = [ button1, button2 ];
navigationItem.rightButtons = [ button3, button4 ];
```

After adding buttons, it can be pushed onto a navigation bar:

```
navigationBar.push ( navigationItem );
```

If further `NavigationItem`s are pushed, a back button appears with the title of the previous `NavigationItem`. The user could pop it manually (by pressing the back button), or it can be popped  programmatically:

```
navigationBar.pop ();
```

Note: When pushing and popping `NavigationItem`s, be careful not to do anything else with a `NavigationBar` or `NavigationItem` during the animation process, or you will corrupt the view hierarchy. As iOS animations are fixed-duration, it's best
to delay about 400ms (perhaps even a little longer) to get around any animation.

Navigation items can fire events when they are popped and pushed with the `pop` and `push` events.

##### Properties

* `title <String>` - the name of the `NavigationItem`
* `leftButtons <Array of BarButton>` - `Array` of `BarButton`s to display on the left side of the `NavigationItem`
* `rightButtons <Array of BarButton>` - `Array` of `BarButton`s to display on the right side of the `NavigationItem`

##### Methods

* `destroy` - destroys the control

##### Events

* `push` - fired when this `NavigationItem` is pushed onto a `NavigationBar`
* `pop` - fired when this `NavigationItem` is popped from a `NavigationBar` (or when a user taps the back button on a `NavigationItem`)


#### `ToolBar`s

`ToolBar`s can be created like this:

```
var toolbar = window.nativeControls.ToolBar();
toolbar.buttons = [button1, button2];
toolbar.tintColor = window.nativeControls.Color ("blue");
toolbar.addToView();
```

Toolbars can also be positioned by changing their `frame` property.

##### Properties

* `tintColor <Color>` - The tint color for any `BarButton`s on iOS 7; background color on iOS 6;
* `buttons <Array of BarButton>` - `Array` of `BarButton`s to display in the center of the `ToolBar`
* `frame <Rect>` - the location of the tool bar on screen


##### Methods

* `addToView` - adds the tool bar to the web view
* `removeFromView` - removes the tool bar from the web view
* `destroy` - destroys the control

##### Events

* None



### `MessageBox`es, Input boxes, and `ActionSheeet`s

These are lumped together, because although they are presentationally different (on iPhone), they are very similar logically.

A message box can be created as follows:

```
var messageBox = window.nativeControls.MessageBox();
messageBox.title = "Title of the message";
messageBox.text = "Are you sure?";
messageBox.addButtons ( [ "Yes", "No", "Cancel" ] );
messageBox.cancelButtonIndex = 2; // zero-based
messageBox.addEventListener ( "tap", function ( evt ) { console.log ( evt.data ); } );
messageBox.show();
```

Message boxes can be hidden by calling `hide` -- any event handler will be called with the cancel button index.

Alert boxes are created very similarly, except they don't support the `text` property.  Furthermore, they add an additional property called `destructiveButtonIndex` that can be used to specify which button will have a destructive effect, like so:

```
var actionSheet = window.nativeControls.ActionSheet();
actionSheet.title = "Title of sheet";
actionSheet.addButtons ( [ "Delete", "Share", "Cancel" ] );
actionSheet.cancelButtonIndex = 2;
actionSheet.destructiveButtonIndex = 0;
actionSheet.show();
```

Input boxes are Message boxes with a different `alertType`:

```
messageBox.alertType = "input" // or secureInput, default, userNameAndPassword
messageBox.inputText = "default text";
messageBox.passwordText = "default password"; // only if userNameAndPassword
```

Input boxes can fire additional events: `inputChanged` and `passwordChanged`. They also pass along the contents of the input fields when a `tap` occurs. Currently only supported on iOS 7; **will crash on iOS 6**.

```
messageBox.addEventLister ( "tap", function ( evt )
{
  var data = JSON.parse(atob(evt.data));
  var buttonPressed = data.buttonPressed;
  var inputText = data.values[0];
  var passwordText = data.values[1];
}
```

##### Properties

* `title <String>` - The title of the alert
* `text <String>` - Secondary text of the alert; valid only for `messageBox` (not `actionSheet`)
* `cancelButtonIndex <Integer>` - specifies which button is the cancel button; zero-based
* `destructiveButtonIndex <Integer>` - specifies which button is destructive; zero-based. Only available for `actionSheet`s
* `type <String>` - specifies the type of `MessageBox`; one of `default` (normal `MessageBox`), `input` (`MessageBox` with one input field), `secureInput` (`MessageBox` with one input field that masks characters), and `userNameAndPassword` (`MessageBox` with a username field and password field). Only available for `MessageBox`
* `inputText` - sets the default text for a `MessageBox` with an input field; only available for `MessageBox`
* `passwordText` - sets the default password for a `MessageBox` with username and password fields; only available for `MessageBox`

##### Methods

* `show` - displays the alert
* `hide` - dismisses the alert; any handler is called indicating that the `cancelButtonIndex` button was tapped
* `destroy` - destroys the control

##### Events

* `tap` - fired whenever a button is tapped or the alert is dismissed. The button tapped is specified in the `data` field of the `event` (zero-based). For `MessageBox`es having data fields, the `data` field of the `event` object is a Base64-encoded JSON object of the following form:

```
{ buttonPressed: #,
  values: [ textField1 [,textField2 ] ]
}
```

## Protocol

Communication from JavaScript over the native bridge are queued internally. The queue only processes one command at a time and executes commands in the order they were queued.

Commands can be enqueued by calling `window.nativeControls.queueExec` with the following parameters:

* The native control
* The command (string)
* Command data
* success handler (optional)
* failure handler (optional)

The queue is processed whenever `queueExec` is called and as long as there are items in the queue. Commands are then sent over to the native side by using `cordova.exec` passing `PKNativeControls` and `handleOperation` as the method call. Data passed includes the control's class, unique ID, the command, and the command data.

The native side receives these values and acts on them according to the type of control, the control's unique ID, and the command. If the operation is successful, the succes handler is called. If the operation fails, the failure handler is called.

### Events

Controls that can send events do so using `cordova.fireDocumentEvent`. The event is of the form `UUID_Event`. For example, if a control has an ID of `28bbc290-d3df-4df3-ac58-e23296bcb7ea` and a `tap` event is fired, a document event of `28bbc290-d3df-4df3-ac58-e23296bcb7ea_tap` is fired. A native control's `addEventListener` method simply registers for this event name.

Return data is passed via a `data` object when using `cordova.fireDocumentEvent`; this is accessible to event handlers by using `event.data`.

## Change Log

```
1.0.0  First Release
1.0.1  Merged pull request #2; toolbar didn't use correct buttons 
       array.
1.0.2  Documentation fixes
1.1.0  Lots of changes:
        - Navigation Bar offset should be 20px and height 
          should be 44px on iOS 7 as navigation bars now 
          properly report their position as attached to the 
          status bar. **this may be a breaking change!**
        - setTextColor added to Navigation Bars
        - BarTextButton and BarImageButton added (BarButton 
          deprecated). Do not mix your use here; do not assign 
          an icon to a BarTextButton and vice versa or you will 
          experience layout issues
        - Messageboxes with input fields now report that data 
          better (see above documentation); **this is a breaking 
          change!**
        - Rects and Colors can be copied by passing the object to 
          be copied to their respective create methods. eg:
            var aRectCopy = window.nativeControls.Rect(aRect)
        - Global colors are now customizable. Add a new color:
            window.nativeControls.acolor = 
              window.nativeControls.Color(100,20,255,1);
          DO NOT use camelCase this will cause lookups to fail
          when using window.nativeControls.Color("acolor");
        - Buttons added. Thanks to and for Matt!
